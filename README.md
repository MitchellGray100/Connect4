JavaFX Connect4 Game. Local 2 Player or 1 Player (With AI).
It's Connect4.

As a personal project I created a JavaFX representation of a Connect4 game. The game displays each move and displays when the game is over. The Gameover Text is red, yellow, or orange based on who won. The AI could've used a Minimax algorithm (Like my [Chess project](https://github.com/MitchellGray100/Chess)) but this would lead to a tie or a win for the AI every single time. This would not be very enjoyable for someone just playing for fun. Instead, the AI assigns points to good behaviors.
